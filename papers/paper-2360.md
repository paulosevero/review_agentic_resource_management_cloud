# paper-2360 — An Intelligent Predictive Resource Management Framework for Cloud-Native Systems Based on Large Language Models

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> As cloud-native architectures gained ubiquity, microservices enhance system flexibility. But because of their distributed nature, they are also confronted with intricate inter-service dependencies. The result is that fault identification is challenging and conventional reactive resource capacity expansion strategies have response lags, compromising operations and maintenance. As a response to such challenges, this paper puts forward an intelligent predictive resource management framework for cloud-native systems using a large oracle model. This architecture amalgamates open source libraries such as OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Loki to capture and process three types of observability data consistently: logs, metrics, and tracebacks. A visualization dashboard is also built to offer improved operational visibility. The novelty in this paper relies on adding a predictive autoscaling framework with the use of the LLM. Six scenarios for loading are proposed, merging the LLM with mathematical classification definitions. Based on the integration of text and image information, a bimodal analysis method is employed to intelligently identify load patterns and select the optimal prediction model. Experiments indicate that compared with previous practices, this approach significantly improves prediction accuracy and efficiency in resource utilization, and it provides a new technical means for cloud-native system operation and maintenance. © 2025 IEEE.
