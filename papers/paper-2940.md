# paper-2940 — Multi-Agent Transformer approach for collaborative task offloading and resource optimization in NOMA-based Vehicular Edge Computing

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> The rapid evolution of Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) necessitates the efficient processing of massive vehicle-generated data under strict real-time constraints. To address this, this paper proposes a hybrid optimization framework integrating Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) and Lagrangian optimization to jointly solve task offloading and resource allocation problems, aiming to maximize the service success rate. The problem is decoupled into two sub-problems: (1) joint transmission power and offloading decision-making, and (2) edge node computing resource allocation. Specifically, we employ the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) to tackle cooperative offloading and power control, leveraging its auto-regressive architecture to enable sequential, coordinated decision-making among agents. Subsequently, Lagrangian optimization is utilized to derive the globally optimal resource allocation under constraints. Extensive simulations based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed methodology significantly improves system performance compared to existing baselines. © 2026 Elsevier B.V.
