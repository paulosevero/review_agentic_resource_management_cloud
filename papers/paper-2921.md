# paper-2921 — Service reliability of intelligent computing cluster systems for large language models

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> Intelligent computing cluster system (ICCS) is a distributed computing infrastructure designed for training large language models (LLMs). Most of the existing reliability works on computing systems has predominantly focued on conventional architectures, such as generic data center networks and conventional cloud infrastructures. To our knowledge, the service reliability of new computing infrastructure, ICCS, has not been studied in literature. This paper bridges the gaps between academic research and industrial practice by developing a comprehensive service reliability framework for ICCS on LLM. The service reliability is defined from the perspective of the execution of parallelized training, taking into account the hybrid parallelism strategy of pipeline and data parallelism. The reliability assessment approach is developed concerning the inherent uncertainies on GPU performance. Meanwhile, to improve the service reliability metric, a reliability optimization problem is constructed to derive an optimal parallelism strategy, called RDpipe. The computational experiments are conducted to analyze the service reliability facing the different environmental settings. The results show that the derived RDpipe strategy has higher reliability and more stable performance than other classical parallelism strategies. © 2026 Elsevier Ltd.
