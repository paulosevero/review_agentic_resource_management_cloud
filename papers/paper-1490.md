# paper-1490 — SCOOT: SLO-Oriented Performance Tuning for LLM Inference Engines

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> As large language models (LLMs) are gaining increasing popularity across a wide range of web applications, it is of great importance to optimize service-level objectives (SLOs) for LLM inference services to enhance user satisfaction and improve the competitiveness of cloud vendors. In this paper, we observe that adjusting the parameters of LLM inference engines can improve service performance, and the optimal parameter configurations of different services are different. Therefore, we propose SCOOT, an automatic performance tuning system to optimize SLOs for each LLM inference service by tuning the parameters of the inference engine. SCOOT jointly exploits single-objective and multiple-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) techniques to handle various optimization objectives via exploration and exploitation. Moreover, SCOOT prunes the search space with known constraints and adopts a random forest to learn hidden constraints during the tuning process to mitigate invalid exploration. To improve the tuning efficiency, SCOOT utilizes the parallel suggestion to accelerate the tuning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SCOOT considerably outperforms existing tuning techniques in SLO optimization while greatly improving the tuning efficiency. Moreover, SCOOT is universally applicable to various LLM inference engines including vLLM and TensorRT-LLM. Currently, SCOOT has already been implemented in the production environment at Ant Group. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
