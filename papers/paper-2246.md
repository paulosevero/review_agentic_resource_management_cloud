# paper-2246 — A Framework for Gen AI Adoption for Enterprises Leveraging Enterprise Architecture Patterns

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> Organizations that operate in dynamic digital transformations currently use Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) to establish innovation while improving operational efficiency and creating new business opportunities. Achieving successful Gen AI adoption brings technical difficulties, mainly from entering existing enterprise systems. The main objective of this study is to explore how EA facilitates the seamless adoption of Gen AI by aligning information systems, business processes, and technology frameworks. The research also analyzes key EA patterns, including Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), and microservices to assist efficient AI integration. A phased approach is proposed for implementing Gen AI, comprising use case identification, organizational readiness assessment, technology selection, and pilot testing. Next, the study presents an implementation roadmap, emphasizing scaling strategies, change management, governance, and continuous monitoring. Finally, the paper determines the future trends in AI regulations, industry collaborations, and technological advancements that provides insights for organizations aiming to leverage Gen AI effectively within their enterprise frameworks.  © 2025 IEEE.
