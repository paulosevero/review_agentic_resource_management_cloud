# paper-0653 — Adaptive MARL-based Joint Cooperative Caching and Resource Allocation for Deep Edge Networks

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> With the rapid development of mobile communications services and applications, deep edge networks (DENs) have become a new paradigm for addressing data traffic and network delay by combining mobile edge computing (MEC) and artificial intelligence (AI). In this network, edge caching can provide low-latency and reliable services in resource-constrained scenarios by caching content in the wireless access points (APs). In this paper, we propose a joint cooperative caching replacement and resource allocation algorithm based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), which aims to minimize the average content download delay. The proposed algorithm regards each AP as a reinforcement learning agent that receives diverse state information (e.g., user request behaviors, cache status updates, content popularity information, and network conditions) to learn the caching replacement and bandwidth resource allocation strategy to maximize system rewards. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently decrease global content download delay, improve network efficiency, and enhance the user experience when compared to the benchmark algorithm. © 2023 IEEE.
