# paper-2606 — Deadline-Aware joint optimization of task offloading and resource allocation for cell-Free mobile edge computing networks

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> The increasing demand for wireless applications with tight deadlines and intensive computational requirements has exposed the limitations of traditional mobile edge computing (MEC). In such a tight deadline task processing environment, it is inevitable that some tasks cannot be processed within the deadline and are dropped. To tackle this, we formulate an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of the dropout ratio and average delay. To solve the problem, we present an integrated method that combines MEC with cell-free networks. In addition, we propose the Joint optimization of Association, Beamforming, Task Offloading, and Resource Allocation (JAB-TORA), which accounts for realistic wireless conditions. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and address it using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach. Simulation results demonstrate the inversely proportional relationship between the dropout ratio and the average delay when adjusting the weights. These weights can be adjusted to meet the required dropout ratio or delay level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a lower dropout ratio and delay than other offloading methods. © 2026 Elsevier B.V.
