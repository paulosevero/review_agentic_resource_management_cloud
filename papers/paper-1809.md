# paper-1809 — Latency-Aware Function Offloading with 5G Integration for Intelligent Connected Vehicles

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> The emergence of heavy AI models, such as Vision-Language Models and Vision-Language Action Models, has enabled complex perception and decision-making in intelligent connected vehicles. However, their growing computational demands often exceed the capabilities of onboard vehicle hardware. Offloading computation to the cloud offers improved scalability but introduces challenges in network reliability and real-time responsiveness. This paper presents a latency-aware function offloading framework that enables fine-grained, distributed latency monitoring across the offloading pipeline. Additionally, it integrates declarative control of network quality using 5G network APIs. We validate the framework through real-world experiments involving two VLMs deployed on two commercial vehicle System-on-Chip platforms across six public driving scenarios. The results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in tracking latency and optimizing soft real-time execution under public 5G networks, thereby improving the reliability, scalability, and responsiveness of cloud-enhanced vehicular functions.  © 2025 IEEE.
