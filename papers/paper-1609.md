# paper-1609 — Cross-Modal Causal Fusion and Bidirectional Reasoning for Microservice Root-Cause Analysis

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> Root-cause analysis (RCA) in large-scale microservice systems is difficult because monitoring data are heterogeneous, service dependencies are complex, and environments are noisy. Existing methods often use single-modality analysis or shallow fusion, and this limits their ability to capture causal dependencies and give interpretable reasoning. This work presents DO-MARCA, a DeepSeek-orchestrated multi-agent framework that brings together metric, log, and trace data through modalityspecific neural encoders and structured agent collaboration. A cross-modal causal fusion module aligns heterogeneous signals, and a bidirectional reasoning graph in the LLM context maintains evolving hypotheses and supports interpretability. By using temporal convolutional networks, graph attention networks, and language model reasoning with dynamic orchestration, DOMARCA improves robustness, accuracy, and explainability of RCA in microservice environments. © 2025 IEEE.
