# paper-2218 — Queue-Aware Joint Resource Allocation in Cell-Free MEC Using Lyapunov-Guided MAPPO

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> This paper proposes a queue-aware resource allocation framework for Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO)-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. By modeling both local and edge-side task queues, we formulate a long-term energy minimization problem under queue stability constraints. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization, the problem is decomposed into per-slot subproblems: local CPU control is solved in closed form, while a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm learns transmit power and AP clustering. Simulations show that the proposed approach achieves superior energy-delay tradeoff over a heuristic baseline.  © 2025 IEICE.
