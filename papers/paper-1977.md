**Abstract**

> As cloud computing becomes more and more integral to today’s IT landscape from web hosting to supporting Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, the infrastructure design is more and more complex per its requirements. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) provides the ability to provision and supports computing infrastructure using code instead of manual processes and settings. Even though writing IaC is not an easy task, it requires knowing different infrastructure programming languages and abstractions, each with a focus on aspects of infrastructure creation, configuration and management. Nowadays, many companies also host their essential and vital business services through hybrid cloud solutions or multi-cloud solutions which has led to increase complexity in provisioning and maintaining infrastructure. The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings a new level of intelligence to automate in cloud computing infrastructure. Complex job automation, resource allocation optimization, and overall system efficiency may all be achieved with generative artificial intelligence. This paper focuses on how artificial intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping cloud computing and automating infrastructure. And this also focuses on empirical experiments that demonstrate the application of GenAI in building and managing infrastructure, both in local environments and on the AWS (Amazon Web Services) platform. By combining theoretical insights with hands-on experimentation, this paper provides insights into the future trajectory of IT infrastructure automation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.
