# paper-2521 — Modernization of enterprise payment infrastructure: A case study on LLM-assisted migration of legacy distributed systems

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> Context: Modernizing mission-critical financial infrastructure is often impeded by the compounding technical debt and architectural inertia of decade-old frameworks. In high-volume environments, these legacy C# implementations pose significant obstacles to cloud-native scalability and PCI compliance. Objectives: This study explores a resource-efficient modernization strategy that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as strategic “thinking partners.” The research specifically investigates the redesign of intricate session management and deeply coupled dependencies, prioritizing low-risk operational continuity over a volatile system replacement. Methods: Employing an industrial case study methodology following Runeson and Höst guidelines, the research details the transition of a legacy distributed system to a cloud-native architecture (GCP Cloud Run/AdonisJS). The migration was governed by a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) framework, in which AI-driven proposals were rigorously manually validated and refined using constraints. Performance was evaluated across 10 independent test cycles (N=100), mirroring peak-load production volume. Results: The HITL-governed workflow achieved 50% compression of the development lifecycle (change lead time) compared to traditional benchmarks. Post-migration metrics indicated a successful decoupling of monolithic components, resulting in a 67% normalized reduction in anomalous runtime events and a statistically significant 57% reduction in mean response latency (p < 0.001) during peak-load simulations. Conclusion: This research demonstrates that LLMs can substantially mitigate the fiscal and operational overhead of legacy migration when integrated into a structured HITL framework. This acceleration suggests a fundamental evolution in the Senior Software Engineer's mandate—pivoting from manual implementation toward strategic architectural orchestration and high-fidelity validation. © 2026 The Author
