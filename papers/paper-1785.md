**Abstract**

> Satellite Edge Computing (SEC), as an emerging paradigm for the development of satellite–terrestrial integrated networks, provides robust computational support for terrestrial networks. However, with the continuous growth in the number of users, the gap between limited network resources and the ever-increasing demands for computation and transmission has posed significant challenges to satellite–terrestrial integrated networks. To address this issue, we investigate a novel satellite–terrestrial collaborative paradigm within the framework of SEC-based satellite–terrestrial networks (SECTNs) to efficiently handle the computational tasks of ground users. Considering the stochastic arrival of user tasks with varying service requirements, as well as time-varying computational resources and constrained system energy, we formulate a satellite–terrestrial collaborative computation offloading problem with the optimization objectives of system delay, energy consumption, and service ratio. The problem is modeled as a Generalized Assignment Problem, which serves to allocate computational tasks to available resources in a manner that balances efficiency and resource utilization. Subsequently, we propose an intelligent computation offloading scheme based on the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, incorporating a carefully designed reward function to balance multiple objectives and prevent over-optimization of a single objective. Finally, comprehensive performance evaluations are conducted through simulations, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms benchmark algorithms in system performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.
