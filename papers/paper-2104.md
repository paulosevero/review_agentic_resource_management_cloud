# paper-2104 — Agent Shadowing: Edge-Driven Seamless Integration for Edge and Cloud AI Agents

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> The evolution of modern multi-agent architectures is increasingly characterized by the distributed deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) agents across heterogeneous networks, including on-premise environments and those shielded by network address translation (NAT) or firewall constraints. This architectural paradigm introduces significant challenges in seamlessly orchestrating multi-agent systems, as agents often lack direct inbound accessibility from external peers despite possessing outbound internet connectivity. Loss of direct reachability complicates the discovery and dynamic integration of agents, particularly when secure, scalable, and vendor-neutral agent-to-agent (A2A) communication is required across operational boundaries. We propose an architecture that leverages Google's A2A protocol and a shadowing mechanism to enable seamless collaboration between LLM-driven agents based on edges and cloud counterparts driven by the edge agent, reducing the reliance on centralized infrastructure and preserving data locality. A prototype implementation on the Siemens Cloud Agent Orchestration Framework and Siemens Industrial Edge demonstrates secure bidirectional connectivity with cloud orchestration, and the design principles are broadly applicable across diverse edge-cloud ecosystems.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
