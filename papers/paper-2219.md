# paper-2219 — Agentic AI-Driven Real-Time Inventory Management Using Distributed Cloud Architectures and Machine Learning

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> This paper deploys integration of machine learning with agnostic real-time inventory management and distributed architectures. This work focuses on automating inventory handling through AI agents that automatically forecast inventory levels, variability of demands, and replenishment requirements. Distributed architectures can scale and facilitate low-latency and high availability in data management and processing globally between retailers or chain retailers and e-commerce. Some machine learning techniques, like time-series forecasts and anomaly detection, were used to predict inventory requirements and future supply chain disruptions. Experimental trials showed an increase in accuracy by 30% in inventories and a 25% reduction in stockout compared to conventional inventory handling systems. The system also showed a 15% reduction in overstocking and, hence, cost-effectiveness, plus utilization of storage spaces. The evidence presented here indicates the capacity of AI and cloud-based technology to plug the inventory processing gap. © 2025 IEEE.
