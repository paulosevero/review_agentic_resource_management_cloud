# paper-1628 — WiP: From Wasted Compute to Quality Gains: LLM Test-Time Scaling on Mobile NPUs

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> With advancements in the performance of small-sized LLMs and Mobile SoCs, deploying LLMs on edge devices such as mobile phones is becoming a reality. The emerging NPU (Neural Processing Unit) units on mobile SoCs, with their specialized neural network acceleration capabilities and lower power consumption, have become ideal processors for running LLM workloads. We identify that the NPU's core matrix multiplication units perform computations at a large tile granularity, leading to significant underutilization of computational resources during the autoregressive decoding phase of LLMs. Therefore, we propose leveraging test-time scaling techniques to fully utilize this wasted NPU compute capacity to enhance the performance of small on-device models. To address accuracy degradation associated with NPU-native coarse-grained quantization, we implement mixed-precision operators that support fine-grained group quantization to strike a balance between memory footprint and accuracy. Preliminary results show that a 1B model with test-time scaling can achieve a better accuracy-latency trade-off on complex reasoning tasks like MATH than a 3B model without scaling.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
