**Abstract**

> The growth in customer requirements, big data analysis and pressures on response time, high costs of network platforms pushed companies to migrate to C loud Computing providing on demand internet hosted IT services. The increase of Cloud users and their interactions with the Cloud infrastructure raise the risk of resources faults. Such a problem can lead to a bad reputation of the Cloud environment, which slows down the evolution of this paradigm. The dynamic architecture and the complex system of the Cloud should be taken into account, hi fact, this paradigm Cloud requires that resources protection and healing must be effective, transparent and without external intervention. Thus, it is essential the use fundamental aspects of autonomic Computing in the Cloud to deal with the self-healing of Cloud security. The high degree of match between autonomic Computing systems and multi-agent systems permit to create an intelligent architecture Cloud that support autonomic aspects. Therefore, we propose a cooperative framework based on Hybrid intrusion detection system (Hy-IDS), mobile Agents and Firewall, which permit to detect both insider and outsider attacks with high detection accuracy in Cloud environment, hi this paper, we propose a Cloud Computing framework offering the access security, ease of resources management using mobile agents and service availability in a reliable structure with lower cost. © 2019 The Authors.
