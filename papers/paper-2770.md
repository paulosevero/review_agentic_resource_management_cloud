# paper-2770 — A generative AI-based approach for resilient service composition under cybersecurity attacks in cloud-fog networks

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> Cyberattacks such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and ransomware degrade service quality in fog–cloud systems by overloading links and temporarily compromising nodes. This study proposes a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) with a fully connected (non-recurrent) generator and discriminator to produce task-to-server allocations at each scheduling cycle. The cGAN is trained offline on logged system states and Quality of Service (QoS) outcomes; at runtime, it maps the current state to a candidate allocation that is projected onto feasibility (capacity, bandwidth, and latency constraints). A lightweight anomaly detector runs in parallel and, upon detection, triggers a reactive migration policy that reallocates affected tasks to healthy resources. A discrete-event simulation evaluates bursty DDoS traffic and node-level ransomware compromises across multiple attack intensities and network sizes. Results show that the proposed allocator improves the composite quality-of-service (combining latency, completion rate, and energy) by approximately 7% under high-intensity attacks relative to non-generative baselines, while maintaining a balanced CPU utilization level. Ablation experiments (no-GAN, no-migration, no-QoS penalty) confirm that both the generative allocator and the migration trigger contribute materially to resilience. The approach offers a practical path to real-time, attack-aware orchestration in fog–cloud environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.
