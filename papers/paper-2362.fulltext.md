Abstract -Heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS) comprise various intelligent agents with specialized functions, such as drones, ground robots, and automated devices, working in coordinated settings. This paper presents AutoHMA-LLM, a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with classical control algorithms to address the challenges of task coordination and scheduling in complex, dynamic environments. The framework is designed with a multi-tier architecture, utilizing a cloud-based LLM as the central planner alongside device-specific LLMs and Generative Agents to improve task execution efficiency and accuracy. Specifically targeting dynamic scenarios, the system enhances resource utilization and stabilizes task execution through refined task scheduling and real-time feedback mechanisms. In experiments conducted across logistics, inspection, and search & rescue scenarios, AutoHMALLM demonstrated a 5.7% improvement in task completion accuracy, a 46% reduction in communication steps, and a 31% decrease in token usage and API calls compared to baseline methods.

agents with different capabilities. However, coordinating communication and scheduling tasks presents significant challenges, with consistency in temporal protocols among agents leading to inefficiencies and potential conflicts [4], [5]. Traditional task planning methods are poor in scalability because of its static design, which require onerous code modification specially in complex environments. This underscores the need for efficient, intelligent, autonomous task scheduling and communication coordination in these systems.

LLMs like GPT-4 [6], GPT-3.5 [7], and LLAMA2 [8] excel in natural language understanding, logical reasoning, and generalization. Capable of processing diverse data, generating coherent responses, and adapting to various tasks, LLMs offer innovative solutions to the challenges of communication coordination and task scheduling in heterogeneous systems. LLMs effectively address the complexities of dynamic environments by enhancing understanding and planning capabilities and optimizing resource utilization through intelligent task decomposition and dynamic scheduling.

This paper introduces a novel framework utilizing a hybrid of large and small models to address communication coordination, dynamic task decomposition, and scheduling issues in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Combining the understanding capabilities of large models with the computational efficiency of small models, this approach coordinates temporal protocols among agents, reduces inconsistencies, and optimizes computational resource utilization. The framework is advantageous for implementing autonomous multi-agent networks wirelessly, maintaining high efficiency in various environments, thus enhancing task reliability and performance. The architecture achieves effective communication coordination and task scheduling by integrating LLMs' powerful reasoning capabilities with smaller models' efficiency. This includes a control layer, Cloud LLM, Device LLM, and Generative Agents collaborating to optimize task allocation and resource utilization. Our contributions include:

## II. RELATED WORKS

## A. Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MARL) [9] has enhanced agent capabilities in various jobs, such as path planning, obstacle avoidance and agent control. This makes it possible to build complex multi-agent systems. Q-learning [10] operates on the principle of maximizing the expected sum of rewards across all consecutive steps. This algorithm enables agents to make decisions based on strategies that yield the highest returns over the long term, which is crucial in dynamic and complex environments. Integrating Q-learning into MARL frameworks such as MA-PPO [11], QMIX [12], and QPLEX [13] has enhanced their effectiveness, providing a robust mechanism for agents to assess and adjust their strategies in real time. MA-POCA [14] utilizing these principles combined with counterfactual reasoning from the COMA [15], further optimizes reward distribution among agents, significantly enhancing cooperation and collective decision-making within agent groups. This paper also utilizes Q-learning within Generative Agents, achieving notable results across various scenarios.

## B. LLMs for Multi-Agent

LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing multiagent systems in planning, coordination, and task reasoning. Early works like SayCan [16] and Inner Monologue [17] focused on single-agent scenarios, using environmental feedback to improve planning and scheduling. Studies such as CaP [18], ProgGPT [19], and Demo2Code [20] demonstrated LLMs' capability in generating adaptable policies, broadening their applications to diverse tasks and agent behaviors. In motion planning, frameworks like AutoTAMP [21] and LLMGROP [22] integrated LLMs with traditional Task and Motion Planning (TAMP), enabling more dynamic task execution in complex environments. However, these efforts were largely limited to single-agent or centralized planning [23].

Recent research has shifted towards multi-agent systems, addressing challenges in collaboration and scalability. RoCo [24] introduced a dialectic framework for LLM-driven multi-robot collaboration, facilitating interaction and coordination among agents. Another study [25] examined centralized and decentralized multi-robot frameworks, utilizing LLMs to enhance task distribution and communication. Building on these advancements, our approach introduces a novel multi-agent framework that employs LLMs for real-time task reasoning and strategy adjustment. Unlike previous works relying on static policies or single-threaded planning, our framework dynamically adapts to complex, interdependent tasks, improving both scalability and performance in multiagent environments.

## C. Multi-Agents Collaboration and Planning

Research in multi-agent manipulation has a long-standing history. The first cluster of studies focuses on low-level problems such as finding collision-free motion trajectories, where sampling methods are commonly employed, and various algorithmic improvements have been proposed. Recent efforts have also explored learning-based methods. Some work focused on addressing more challenging scenarios requiring sophisticated low-level controls, such as involving dynamic objects or closed-chain kinematics [24]. The second cluster of work concentrates more on high-level planning to allocate and coordinate sub-tasks, which is more relevant to our work [25]. Although most prior work customized their systems for limited tasks like furniture assembly [26], our work emphasizes the flexibility and scalability to accomplish a wide range of tasks in real-world scenarios.

## III. SYSTEM DEFINITION

Tasks involving collaborative efforts from heterogeneous multi-agent systems [27] in diverse operational scenarios usually encompass different entities, which we denote as ˜ H = { ˜ U , ˜ V , ˜ R } , namely UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), vehicles (cars or ships), and robots (warehouse robots or inspection robots). These agents are organized as,

[formula]

where N U , N V , N R represent the total number of agents in each group. For each team in ˜ H , an extended Markov Decision Process (MDP) is defined, named M ˜ U , M ˜ V , and M ˜ R , where the state of each agent at time t is specified as U t n t , V t n q , and R t n w , respectively. The set containing the state of each agent at any given time is denoted as,

[formula]

The algorithm applied to each team ensures convergence to a cooperative strategy under a specified reward function. To stimulate the intelligence of heterogeneous agents, we formulate an optimization problem,

IV. METHOD

A. Multi-Agent System Architecture

This section elaborates on the overall framework and deployment architecture of the heterogeneous multi-agent system proposed. As depicted in Figures 1, it integrates Cloud LLM, Device LLMs and Generative Agents. The primary goal of this system is to achieve intelligent scheduling and coordinated work through efficient task decomposition, allocation, coordination, and feedback mechanisms.

1. Overall Framework: Within this architecture, the cloud LLM is a central planner responsible for receiving and refining task directives from the control layer into actionable instructions for specific agents. It continuously optimizes task allocation and execution by leveraging real-time node self-correction feedback and environmental feedback. These refined task directives will be disseminated to Device LLMs, ensuring an effective distribution and execution of tasks across various devices. As the planner, the Cloud LLM coordinates task allocation in global, while fostering collaboration among agents through real-time feedback mechanisms, ultimately enhancing the system's efficiency.

Fig. 2. Deployment structure of the AutoHMA-LLM system, highlighting the hierarchical coordination among the Cloud LLM, Device LLMs, and Generative Agents, enabling real-time task execution and feedback in a wireless network environment.

<!-- image -->

Device LLMs, serving as dispatchers, are embedded in various devices like tablets, laptops, and unmanned vehicles. They receive task directives from the Cloud LLM and relay detailed subtask plans to Generative Agents. Depending on the agents' attributes and the task requirements, Device LLMs dynamically adjust execution plans and guide Generative Agents to perform specific operations. Through a real-time feedback loop, Device LLMs monitor and revise task execution progress, guaranteeing efficient task delivery and execution among Generative Agents.

Generative Agents, as executors, receive subtask directives from Device LLMs and perform tasks ranging from logistics transportation to equipment inspection or search & rescue missions. As they execute, they generate updated state information and provide feedback to both device-level and Cloud LLMs for real-time adjustments and optimizations. In addition to leveraging the strengths of LLMs in task planning and scheduling, Generative Agents also utilize smaller models to execute specific tasks based on subtask action directives, exhibiting high execution efficiency and system-wide coordination. For instance, the employment of Q-Learning model for global path planning enables agents to navigate more efficient and adaptive in complex environments.

2. Deployment Architecture: The wireless Generative Agent network deployment scheme proposed, as illustrated in Figure 2, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating various components to function collaboratively in a practical environment. As the core of the system, the Cloud LLM oversees the overall task planning and distribution. It communicates with Device LLMs, disseminating task directives and collecting feedback information. The Cloud LLM performs global task optimization and refinement by consolidating feedback from various devices.

On various devices, Device LLMs receive task directives from the Cloud LLM and convey detailed action parameters to the Generative Agents. Based on the agents' feedback, Device LLMs dynamically adjust task execution plans, ensuring efficient task execution by the agents.

As the actual executors, Generative Agents perform specific actions based on the instructions from the Device LLMs. These agents, including drones, ground transportation and inspection robots, can operate efficiently in diverse task scenarios. Through a real-time feedback mechanism, the Generative Agents transmit task execution status information back to the device level and Cloud LLMs, enabling timely task adjustments and optimizations. By executing tasks efficiently and providing real-time feedback, the Generative Agents enhance the system's execution efficiency and safety, ensuring the successful completion of tasks in complex environments.

AutoHMA-LLM adopts the Centralized Hybrid approach, optimizing task coordination and resource utilization with a balance of large and small models.

## B. Communication Mechanisms

As illustrated in Figure 3, we discuss six communication modes: the Decentralized Small Model, the Decentralized LLM, the Decentralized Hybrid Model, the Centralized LLM, the Centralized Small Model, and the Centralized Hybrid Model.

The Decentralized Small Model (Fig. 3(a)) enables each small model to independently plan and execute tasks, with agents performing decentralized communication and coordination. This method reduces the burden on the central node but may lead to poor coordination and resource wastage, particularly in complex tasks requiring efficient collaboration. The lack of a global perspective in decentralized agents can result in uneven task distribution, redundant work, and suboptimal resource utilization.

The Decentralized LLM (Fig. 3(b)) allows each agent to use a large language model for task planning and execution, communicating and coordinating in a decentralized way. While this enhances the decision-making capabilities of the agents, the high computational complexity of LLMs leads to reduced efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

The Decentralized Hybrid Model (Fig. 3(c)) combines large and small models, with agents communicating and coordinating in a decentralized manner. Small models handle specific tasks, such as point-to-point path planning and obstacle avoidance, while large models are used for overall task decision-making. This approach improves efficiency to some extent but still suffers from the inherent issues of decentralization, such as high coordination complexity, lack of a global view, uneven resource distribution, and task redundancy.

The Centralized LLM (Fig. 3(d)) employs a central LLM for task planning and scheduling, with all agents receiving and executing instructions from the central node. This method ensures uniform task distribution and scheduling but risks a single point of failure.

Fig. 4. Task decomposition of AutoHMA-LLM. The system incorporates command delivery, task decomposition, agent collaboration, and feedback. Through iterative feedback and optimization, it ensures efficient task allocation, robust agent coordination, and dynamic adaptability for reliable multi-agent operations in complex environments.

<!-- image -->

The Centralized Small Model (Fig. 3(e)) utilizes a central small model for task planning and scheduling, with all agents following the central instructions. This approach is suitable for resource-limited environments but may struggle with complex tasks.

The Centralized Hybrid Model (Fig. 3(f)) blends the central large and small models, combining the strengths of both to enhance system efficiency and reliability. This hybrid approach ensures a balanced and effective task execution, adapting to the limitations of edge devices while maintaining high operational efficiency.

The proposed centralized hybrid model (CentralizedHybrid) combines the advantages of both large and small models, offering an efficient task planning and scheduling approach. The Cloud LLM works as a core coordination module, refining task instructions in real-time according to subordinate information. The Device LLM, acting as the dispatcher, dynamically adjusts execution plans based on agent attributes and current task demands, directing Generative Agents to perform specific operations. This approach boasts efficient scheduling and flexibility: the central LLM handles complex task planning, while the Device LLM refines tasks and guides specific executions.

The resource requirements of the centralized system can be represented as,

[formula]

where R CENTRALIZED is the total resource requirement of the centralized system, N is the number of agents, and C i is the resource consumption of each agent.

## C. Introduction to Task Process

The proposed framework achieves efficient task planning and execution in multi-agent systems through four primary parts: Command Delivery , Task Decomposition , Agent Collaboration , and Feedback . Each component is crucial in optimizing the performance of heterogeneous multi-agent systems, as shown in Figure 4.

1. Command Delivery: The Command Delivery component transmits task instructions from the central control node to each agent. Specifically, the central control node generates an overall task plan based on mission requirements and disseminates these instructions to the individual agents. Upon receiving the instructions, each agent plans and executes its tasks according to the instructions received.

Effective information transmission and coordination are critical during the command delivery process. Each agent must know its tasks and those of others to facilitate coordination and cooperation. This process can be expressed as,

[formula]

where C ( T ) denotes the set of commands at time T , C i ( T ) represents the command delivered to agent i at time T , and N is the number of agents.

2. Task Decomposition: Task Decomposition means breaking down the overall task into multiple subtasks and assigning them to agents respectively. This step requires considering task dependencies and agent capability constraints to ensure efficient execution of each subtask and achieving the overall task objectives. The process of task decomposition can be represented as,

[formula]

where T denotes the set of all tasks, T j represents the j -th subtask, and M is the number of subtasks. Further task allocation can be detailed as,

[formula]

During task decomposition, we provide the LLM with environmental information E (including objects and entities in the environment) and a list of primitive skills ∆ that the agents can perform. This information helps the LLM generate subtasks T ′ :

[formula]

where I is the input instruction, E is the environmental information, and ∆ is the list of agent skills.

3. Agent Collaboration: Agent Collaboration organizes and coordinates all nodes based on the decomposed tasks. It forms one or more agent coalitions to collaboratively complete tasks, considering communication and coordination among agents to ensure smooth task execution. The process of agent collaboration can be described as,

[formula]

where A ( T ) is the set of coalitions at time T , A k ( T ) represents the k -th coalition at time T , and K is the number of coalitions. Each coalition's composition can be expressed as,

[formula]

To achieve effective collaboration, the LLM analyzes the skill sets required for each subtask TS k and the skills of individual agents S i :

[formula]

where T is the set of decomposed tasks for device control, and S is the set of agent skills.

4. Feedback: The Feedback mechanism is a critical component of the proposed multi-agent framework, ensuring dynamic adaptability and optimization throughout task execution. During each iteration, the central planner decomposes a global task into subtasks, assigning each device agent specific responsibilities (e.g., equipment inspection) along with corresponding 3D path points within the task space. Device agents then generate a globally optimized path and delegate specific 3D path computations to smaller models tailored for local execution. This iterative process incorporates multiple validation steps to ensure robust task execution. If any validation fails, the system reverts to the previous state; otherwise, successful feedback is integrated into the agents' prompts for subsequent iterations.

This step ensures the subtask plan adheres to required formats and constraints. It validates the generated output by checking syntax accuracy, ensuring all required keywords and available actions are included. Furthermore, it evaluates whether each action satisfies the operational constraints of the task and the capabilities of the assigned agent. This early-stage check eliminates structural errors and ensures compatibility with the overall task objectives.

After generating and executing actions, each Device LLM reviews its performance and provides localized feedback to the central planner. This feedback includes execution outcomes, encountered challenges, and adjustments made by the device agent. This mechanism allows for real-time refinement of task decomposition and allocation strategies at the central level, enhancing overall system responsiveness.

To prevent conflicts during path planning, the system employs global obstacle avoidance strategies, such as PID control, Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), and QLearning. These methods verify that the planned path is free from collisions and adheres to environmental constraints. Any potential collision triggers a re-evaluation of the path, ensuring safe navigation through complex environments.

The system evaluates intermediate waypoints to ensure smooth and efficient transitions. It optimizes path characteristics by minimizing movement distance, balancing step distribution, and reducing execution time. The goal is to achieve the most effective trajectory for task completion while adhering to safety and resource constraints. If any validation step fails, the system attempts to replan the subtask up to a predefined maximum number of iterations. Should the task remain incomplete within this limit, the iteration is marked as a failure, and the system proceeds to the next cycle without executing any incomplete actions.

The combination of the central planner's dynamic task decomposition, collaborative agent interactions, and comprehensive feedback mechanisms forms a robust feedback loop. This loop continuously refines task execution at both local and global levels, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the system. By leveraging self-correction, self-feedback, collision checks, and optimal path planning, the proposed framework ensures that multi-agent operations are adaptable, resilient, and capable of meeting the demands of diverse and dynamic environments.

## V. EXPERIMENTS

## A. Experimental Settings and Environment

1. Experimental Settings: We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the system across five key aspects [30]: task completion, communication efficiency, algorithm cost, resource utilization, and fault tolerance. Task completion was assessed through Task Completion Accuracy (Success), defined as the percentage of tasks successfully completed within specified time and resource constraints. Communication Efficiency was measured by tracking the number of Communication Steps (Steps) and the Tokens/Data Size exchanged between agents and the central planner, while Algorithm Cost was evaluated based on computational and communication overhead, reflected by the number of API Calls required for algorithm execution. To provide a more detailed understanding of scalability and performance, we included Resource Utilization metrics, specifically Memory Usage per Device LLM (Memory) and System-Wide Computational Overhead (Computation), to gauge memory management and computational demandsboth crucial for efficiency in resource-constrained environments. This multi-dimensional evaluation framework offers a thorough perspective on the AutoHMA-LLM system's effectiveness and operational efficiency. The AutoHMA-LLM is applied in three scenarios: logistics, inspection, and search & rescue. The scenario design is informed by insights from the review presented in [31], and detailed descriptions are provided in Figure 5.

Fig. 5. This figure illustrates three experimental scenarios: logistics, inspection, and search & rescue. In logistics, UA Vs, vehicles, and robots transport items to target locations. In inspection, UA Vs, robots, and sensors work together to monitor facilities. In search & rescue, UA Vs, ships, and robots collaborate to locate and rescue individuals or items.

<!-- image -->

Logistics. In this scenario, multiple intelligent agents collaborate to complete the transportation task of items, which uses UAVs, Autonomous Vehicles, and Warehouse Robots. Each agent moves along its path (red, blue, and green) according to task requirements and ultimately delivers the item to the designated location (star point). Inspection. In this scenario, UAVs, Inspection Robots, and Sensors collaborate to complete the facility's inspection and monitoring tasks. UAVs fly along the red path, robots move along the green path, and sensors are fixed at a specific location. They coordinate their work through wireless communication to complete the facility's inspection. Search & Rescue. In this scenario, UA Vs, Ships, and Rescue Robots collaborate to carry out Search & Rescue missions. UAVs fly along the red path, ships navigate the blue path, and robots move along the green path, intended to locate and rescue individuals or items trapped in a specific location. We will build single or hybrid large and small models to accomplish heterogeneous entity collaboration tasks in logistics, inspection, Search & Rescue scenarios under centralized and decentralized architectures. We choose GPT-4 [6] and Llama2-70B [8] as large models representing open-source and closed-source LLM, respectively. On the other hand, small models employ classic control algorithms, PID [28] and NMPC [29], along with the Q-learning [10]. The controlled objects include the speed and direction of cars, the propeller speed and angle of ships, and UAVs' attitude and quadcopter power. All experiments will be conducted in a MATLAB simulation environment, which realistically simulates environmental interference factors typical of these scenarios.

Fig. 6. Experimental Results of the Centralization-Hybrid. The bar charts display the performance metrics, including Success (%), Steps, API Calls, and Tokens, for the Logistics, Inspection, and Search & Rescue scenarios.

<!-- image -->

2. Experimental Environment: Logistics. We simulated intelligent logistics scenarios using MATLAB 9.12, in which cars, UAVs and robots collaborate to handle the task of item transportation and distribution. In order to simulate a real complex traffic environment, we added cars with random destinations at a lane occupancy rate of 5% to 60%. Inspection. In MATLAB 9.12, UAVs, robots, and sensors collaborate to inspect and monitor the facility. To simulate harsh natural and communication environments, we set a 10% probability of communication delay and a 1% probability of terminal data communication loss to the system. Search & Rescue. Also simulated in MATLAB 9.12, in which UAVs, ships and robots collaborate to rescue people or property trapped at sea. We built a random rough surface with winds in irregular directions to simulate substantial interference on the sea.

## B. Success Rate Statistics and Analysis

Table I shows the performance of the proposed method in three scenarios. Experimental results of the CentralizationHybrid are shown in Figure 6. We have experimented with decentralized and centralized architecture designs. Under different system architecture designs, control algorithms for small, large, and hybrid models were implemented separately, forming six strategies. Then, measure their Success, representing the system's accuracy; Steps, reflecting the ability to break down complex tasks; API Calls, showing the additional cost of executing strategies; and Tokens/Data Size, which means the complexity of the communication process. The results show that in both logistics and rescue scenarios, a centralized hybrid model architecture has the best accuracy in completing tasks. At the same time, the communication overhead is also moderate, making it the most cost-effective solution. The decentralized small model minimizes the cost (API calls and Tokens/Data Size). However, its accuracy is significantly lower than the other five strategies, making it almost impossible to use in the real world.

TABLE I

THIS TABLE PRESENTS THE PERFORMANCE OF AUTOHMA-LLM ACROSS DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THE CENTRALIZED HYBRID MODEL OFFERS THE BEST ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY, WHILE THE DECENTRALIZED SMALL MODEL MINIMIZES COSTS BUT WITH LOWER ACCURACY. NOTE THAT, ALTHOUGH NOT EXPLICITLY SHOWN HERE, A 'HYBRID' VARIANT UNDER DECENTRALIZATION COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED (WITH APPROPRIATE DATA, WHICH IS NOT PROVIDED)

Centralized small models have lower communication costs and higher accuracy, making them a viable low-cost solution. The accuracy of large centralized models is lower than that of the former, and communication costs have sharply increased, making it a less cost-effective solution.

The inspection scenario faces a harsh communication environment that weakens the heavy communication model in the system. Thus, the decentralized hybrid model performs best in this scenario because it eliminates complex and long distance communication with central nodes and also combines the collaborative ability of large models to compensate for the difficulty of miniature models in collaboration.

Introducing large models can significantly improve system accuracy, but it increases communication costs. The heavy communication requirements of large models often become system bottlenecks, so the excessive reliance on large models will reduce the system's robustness. Combining large and small models can complement each other's strengths, ensuring high accuracy while reducing communication costs.

## C. Model Performance Comparison

Table II shows the performance of small model, large model, and hybrid model schemes in three tasks under a centralized architecture.The experimental results show that both GPT-4 and Llama2 can finish processing complex and heterogeneous data returned by the terminal and issuing instructions according to the specified protocol, reflecting the powerful information integration ability of LLM. Among them, whether as a central scheduler or terminal executor, GPT-4 has significantly better system accuracy compared to Llama2, indicating that with the improvement of LLM comprehensive performance, there is also considerable room for improvement in the performance of control systems based on LLM agents.

In Inspection scenario with an unreliable communication environment, a single LLM has the most significant gap compared to the reinforcement learning scheme, with a reduction of about 8% to 16%. The reason is that when LLM participates as an agent in collaborative tasks, it needs to provide detailed descriptions of task rules, current environment, and current state in multiple rounds of dialogue, which leads to a surge in communication overhead. In scenarios with delays and packet losses, it is difficult for the central module to issue correct, reliable, and timely instructions to the terminal. At this point, the advantage of hybrid models is particularly significant, as they can asynchronously call traditional control algorithms or reinforcement learning models to solve most problems, avoiding serious deviations due to untimely communication. The LLM only needs to provide correction suggestions based on the current state at specific times.

Besides, in the logistics and search & rescue scenarios without communication delay and packet loss, the hybrid architecture can still improve the system accuracy by about 3% 16%. This is because the combination of the reinforcement learning model and LLM increases the diversity of terminal output, which significantly benefits the LLM module centrally scheduled. After all, the more diversified the information provided, the more it can stimulate the ability of LLM.

## D. Task Planning and Execution

1. Task Planning: Figure 7 shows the experimental results of the multi-agent system we proposed in three complex scenarios: logistics, inspection and search & rescue. All agents (including UAVs, ground transportation robots, inspection robots, ships, etc.) in each scene will cooperate to complete the task. The figure shows the motion trajectories of each agent at three different times and the location and path of the agent in the process of task execution.

In the logistics scenario (Fig. 7a-7c), the agents include UAV (red path), ground transportation robot (blue path) and warehouse robot (green path). At T 1 (Fig. 7a), the UAV takes off from its initial position, while the ground transportation robot and the warehouse robot also begin to move along the predetermined path. At T 2 (Fig. 7b), the UAV continues to fly in the air, and the ground transportation robot approaches its target position while the warehouse robot is in the middle of the path. The UAV reached the final position at T 3 (Fig. 7c), and the ground transportation robot completed transporting goods. At the same time, the warehouse robot also completed the task and arrived at the designated place.

In the inspection scenario (Fig. 7d-7f), the agents include UAVs (red path), inspection robots (green path) and sensor (grey fixed point). At T 1 (Fig. 7d), the UAV takes off for patrol inspection, and the robot starts moving along the path while the sensor node is fixed at a particular position. At T 2 (Figure 7e), the UAV patrols in the air and the inspection robot continues to move close to the equipment to be inspected. At T 3 (Figure 7f), the UAV completes the inspection task, the robot completes the equipment inspection task, and the sensor node continues monitoring the environment.

In the search & rescue scenario (Fig. 7g-7i), the agents include UAV (red path), ship (blue path) and rescue robot (green path). At T 1 (Fig. 7g), the UAV took off to start the search task, while the ship and rescue robot began to move along the path. At T 2 (Figure 7h), the UAV searches for targets in the air, the ship approaches the rescue position, and the rescue robot moves to the designated area. At T 3 (Figure 7i), the UAV finds the target and completes the search task, the ship arrives at the rescue position, and the rescue robot completes the rescue task.

The performance of this architecture verifies its ability to work intelligently in heterogeneous agent systems. As the central planner, Cloud LLM is responsible for the overall planning and allocating of tasks. As the dispatcher, the Device LLM receives the task instructions from the cloud, details them into specific action parameters and transmits them to the Generative Agent. As the executor, the Generative Agent executes specific tasks according to the instructions of the Device LLM and feeds back the task execution status in real-time. Through the collaborative work of small models (Device LLM) and large models (Cloud LLM), efficient task decomposition, task allocation, and execution processes are realized. In complex task scenarios, the system shows high flexibility and reliability and effectively meets the challenges of multi-agent cooperation.

2. Collision Preventation: There is a risk of collision between agents when performing multi-agent collaborative tasks in complex scenarios. This can also be seen as a unique collaborative problem, and all six strategies mentioned above can avoid it in an ideal environment. However, we found that the collision probability of control schemes based on large

models could be better in actual simulation experiments. The reason is that the large models are relatively slower than others, and they cannot timely issue collision avoidance instructions in dynamic and complex environments. This is also one of the reasons why the accuracy of a single large model scheme in 4.2 is worse than that of a small model. Figure 8 shows a Q-learning collision avoidance model that can quickly and reliably achieve multi-agent collision avoidance. Integrating it into a hybrid model effectively solves the problem of delayed obstacle avoidance in large models, thereby ensuring the safety and practicality of the system.

Our system's fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms are designed to seamlessly handle agent failures or communication disruptions. When an agent fails or loses communication, the system automatically detects the failure and triggers a recovery process, which may involve reassigning tasks to other agents, using backup agents, or adjusting the task plan. The framework employs redundancy, where critical tasks are assigned to multiple agents to ensure task completion even in case of failure. Communication disruptions are mitigated through periodic status checks and local decision-making, allowing agents to continue performing tasks autonomously until communication is restored, ensuring resilience and minimizing the impact of failures on task execution.

## E. Comparative Analysis With Existing Methodologies

The results in Table III illustrate the advantages of the proposed AutoHMA-LLM framework over the baseline method in [25] in terms of task completion accuracy, communication efficiency, and computational performance across logistics, inspection, and search & rescue scenarios. AutoHMA-LLM demonstrates consistent superiority in task completion accuracy, achieving an 85.73% success rate in the logistics scenario compared to 81.42% with the method in [25]. Similar improvements are observed in the inspection and search & rescue scenarios, with AutoHMA-LLM outperforming the baseline by 1.24% and 2.98%, respectively. These improvements underscore AutoHMA-LLM's adaptability and robustness in heterogeneous multi-agent environments.

AutoHMA-LLM also significantly reduces communication overhead, as reflected in fewer communication steps, tokens exchanged, and API calls. For instance, in the logistics scenario, the number of communication steps decreased from 9.55 to 5.11, and the token count reduced by 36.42%. These reductions are consistent across all scenarios, with API calls in the logistics task dropping by 32.32%. Such efficiency is attributed to the hybrid architecture of AutoHMA-LLM, which leverages lightweight, specialized models for localized decision-making, thereby reducing frequent interactions with the LLM. In contrast, the centralized coordination approach in [25] leads to higher communication demands.

In terms of computational performance, the Memory (MB) statistic presented in Table III specifically refers to the memory usage of the Device LLM, reflecting the computational footprint at the local device level. For instance, in the inspection scenario, AutoHMA-LLM reduces memory usage from 60 MB to 40 MB, while computation time is shortened from 11.0 s to 7.8 s. This reduction demonstrates that AutoHMA-LLM achieves a better balance between memory consumption and processing efficiency. The ability to integrate high-level reasoning with task-specific computations enables AutoHMA-LLM to operate effectively in resource-constrained environments, offering significant advantages over existing centralized methods.

## VI. CONCLUSION

This paper proposes a new framework for efficient task coordination and execution in heterogeneous multi-agent systems using LLMs. AutoHMA-LLM shows how Cloud LLM, Device LLM and Generative Agents can jointly optimize task planning, allocation and execution. Our method solves the traditional challenges in multi-agent systems by enhancing communication, reducing resource waste and improving the system's overall efficiency. The experimental results verify our framework's effectiveness in various application scenarios, highlighting its potential in dynamic and complex environments. Future work will continue to improve our framework, explore more application scenarios, and enhance the adaptability and robustness of the system.
