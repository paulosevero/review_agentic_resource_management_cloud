**Abstract**

> Digital twin (DT) has emerged as a potent tool for intelligent resource management in vehicular edge computing (VEC), and it marks a pivotal advancement in VEC via real-time physical entity mapping and state perception. However, due to the complex nature of dynamic state synchronization and multi-dimensional resource coupling in VEC, few existing studies have considered DT deviation and its impacts on network energy consumption and secure transmission. To address these issues, this paper first formulates a collaborative optimization problem integrating DT and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), where GenAI is embedded in the DT model for real-time deviation calibration, and combined with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) achieves efficient co-channel interference suppression; meanwhile, the computation model covers local, cache and multi-step offloading scenarios while deriving latency and energy consumption expressions with security overhead considered. Then, an improved marine predators algorithm (IMPA) is proposed to solve the above mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), which introduces a competitive update mechanism to dynamically balance global exploration and local exploitation via real-time fitness feedback. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed IMPA can converge with low complexity, and compared with existing algorithms, it achieves 83.3% improvement in total energy consumption reduction and 75.3% enhancement in latency stability. © 2020 IEEE.
