# paper-2603 — Generative AI at Application Layer: Mobile AI-generated Content

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> Starting with the general overview of AI-generated content (AIGC), we first discuss how traditional Generative AI (GenAI) services, such as text, image, video, and audio generation, can be used to enable mobile services. We then examine the challenges of building AIGC in practice and limitations of three key components of mobile network infrastructure—cloud, edge, and user devices—analyzing their computational power, privacy preservation capabilities, and latency characteristics. Building on this, we detail how these components can collaborate to enable GenAI services within the mobile network. Next, we reviewed two approaches to enable AIGC models within resource-constrained mobile networks. First, we review model-based techniques that can enhance the efficacy of GenAI models such as quantization, low-rank adaptation, pruning and sparsifying, and knowledge distillation. Second, we discuss methods that can be implemented within wireless networks to enhance the effectiveness of GenAI services, such as distributed training and prompt engineering. We then examine security and privacy considerations at the application layer, discussing threat scenarios, ethical implications, and recommended practices for implementing secure AIGC-as-a-Service models, including decentralized content distribution via blockchain and privacy-preserving approaches like federated learning. We further contextualize these solutions through case studies and use cases, illustrating AIGC's integration into social media, immersive AR/VR streaming, and personalized AI services. Finally, we provide future research directions, exploring evolving challenges related to resource allocation, offloading, edge caching, mobility management, and fairness within AIGC-enabled networks. © 2026 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.
