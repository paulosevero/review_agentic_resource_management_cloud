# paper-0405 — KCL: A Declarative Language for Large-Scale Configuration and Policy Management

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> In recent years, the diversification, complexity, immediacy, and scale of delivery and operational requirements have increased exponentially. For example, delivering and managing complex service mesh and various cloud-native technologies, supporting a variety of operations on infrastructures, such as database, load balancer, dynamic configuration, etc, configuring monitoring for all types of applications, and arranging a range of variety of services and applications to regions across data centers or public clouds. These are just a glimpse of the leopard, and it is actually difficult to list them all. By summarizing and abstracting, we propose the KCL declarative language, development mechanism, and consistent workflow. Through the language model and constraint capabilities, we can improve the large-scale efficiency and liberate multi-team collaborative productivity of operational development and operation systematically while ensuring stability for large-scale configuration and policy management. KCL helps users of various roles to complete operational development and operation tasks in a simple, scalable, stable, efficient, divided-and-conquered manner. To date, the KCL has been used in more than 800 projects, and the average configuration writing and distributing time is shortened from more than 25 days to 2 days. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
