# paper-1685 — AI-Driven Multi-Agent Systems for Optimized Resource Allocation in 5G and Beyond Networks with Edge Computing

## Metadata (from `/03-parse-references-metadata`)

Imported from `legacy/papers/` during v3.2.0 migration. Full machine-readable fields live in the frontmatter.

**Abstract**

> In this study, the authors explore the combination of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and AI-based edge computing to reduce resource management trade-offs in 5G and beyond networks. An MAS approaches resource management in complex network environments, by utilizing a system of interacting and collaborating independent agents. This combines with AI-driven edge computing that allows the processing of data in real time while making local decisions at the point of network connection to speed up responsiveness and performance. The results show that the linking of MAS and edge computing provides an increased network efficiency, low latency, and resource control techniques. Real world testing of this coupled approach has validated the benefits using simulation that indicates combined benefits on network optimization going forward.  © 2025 IEEE.
